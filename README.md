# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A program to emulate the rock, paper, scissors game dating back to ancient China. 
This game is initialized by the user inputting their choice of either rock, paper, or scissors.
Next, the computer(artificial intelligence) will randomly select rock, paper, or scissors to respond to your choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
Lastly, my program will compare the choices of both the computer and the user, to determine a winner, based on the choices made by each participant in the game.
